## Incident Response for cloud.gov

### Part a

cloud.gov developed an Incident Response Guide documenting the procedures required by the 18F and GSA Incident Response Policy.
The guide is disseminated to the whole cloud.gov team to ensure everyone is aware of its existence and contents.
The incident response guide is publicly available at https://docs.cloud.gov/ops/security-ir/ and it is continually updated based on changes to the team and the platform.

### Part b

18F reviews and iterates on the Incident Response Guide at least every three years. cloud.gov reviews and iterates on the Incident Response Guide at least annually.
