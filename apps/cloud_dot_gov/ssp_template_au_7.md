The ELK Stack logging and monitoring system provides additional audit
reduction and report generation capabilities for 18F DevOps and end users of the

can structure and customize audit logs queries to specific app instances, API
calls, system metrics, user access, system components, network traffic flow and
other functions. Kibana is used to generate customized dashboards and Logstash
to generate reports for analysis and review.
