## Incident Response for cloud.gov

### Part a

cloud.gov will make incident response training available to the whole cloud.gov team and will require that at least all operators take it.

### Part b

If the cloud.gov system changes in a radical way, the cloud.gov team will adapt the incident response training to meet the needs of the new system. cloud.gov operators will be required to take the training again.

### Part c

cloud.gov requires all operators to take the incident response training at least once a year.
