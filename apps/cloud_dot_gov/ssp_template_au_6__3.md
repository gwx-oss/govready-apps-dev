## Audit and Accountability Policy for 18F

Audit Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
 * 18F establishes processes for regularly reviewing audit log information, and
 reporting security issues if discovered. Reviews will occur at a minimum of
 weekly. These processes should be integrated with processes for incident response,
 in order to ensure standardization and cross-functional collaboration
 * 18F employs automated mechanisms to integrate audit monitoring, analysis and
 reporting into an overall process for investigation and response to suspicious
 activities.
 * 18F employs automated mechanisms to immediately alert security personnel of
 inappropriate or unusual activities that have security implications.
