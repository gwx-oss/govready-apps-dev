## Contingency Planning Policy for 18F

### Part a

The cloud.gov information system will be leveraging the established alternate processing sites within the AWS IaaS
including necessary agreements to permit the transfer and resumption of cloud.gov operations for essential
missions/business functions when the primary processing capabilities are unavailable.

### Part b

The cloud.gov information system is leveraging the AWS infrastructure as a service to implement the use of multiple AWS
Availability Zones within one AWS region which are dynamically in place and available to support resumption of operations.

### Part c

The use of multiple AWS availability zones employed by the AWS infrastructure as a service provides identical security
safeguards equivalent to that of the primary site.
