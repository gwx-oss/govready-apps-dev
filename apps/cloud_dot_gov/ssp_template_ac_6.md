## Access Control Policies for 18F

IAM policies are attached to the users, enabling centralized control of permissions
for users under 18F AWS Account to access services, buckets or objects. With IAM
policies, 18F only grants users within its own AWS account permission to access
its Amazon resources.
18F AWS IAM policies are defined to grant only the required access for 18F staff
necessary to perform their functions. 18F defines least privilege access to each user,
group, or role.
Security functions within the AWS infrastructure are explicitly defined within IAM to
include read-only permissions for any user functions.
18F incorporate running the IAM Policy Simulator to test policies for least privilege access
for users and groups.
