## Contingency Planning Policy for 18F

Inherited:
To permit the resumption of information system operations for essential missions and business functions without
impact to consumers/customers, 18F has provisioned and leveraged redundant, always-on, internet connections through
the AWS Infrastructure as a service. 18F has accepted the AWS service agreement to provide always-on internet
connections which assure continuous service.
