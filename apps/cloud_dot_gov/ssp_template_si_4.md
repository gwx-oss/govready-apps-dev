## System and Information Integrity Policy for 18F

### Part a

cloud.gov operators monitor the cloud.gov information
system to detect potential attacks and intrusions from internal and external
sources in accordance with the 18F System Information and Integrity Policy section
3 - Information System monitoring, the FedRAMP Incident communication procedures,
and GSA CIO-IT Security-08-39 section "System Monitoring / Audit Record
Review" for GSA specific information systems.

### Part b

18F identifies un-authorized access to the cloud.gov information system using automated monitoring
tools within its virtual private cloud for monitoring, log management and
event analysis. 18F monitors for attacks and indicators of potential attacks,
unauthorized local, network, and remote connections.

### Part c

The infrastructure
that hosts cloud.gov provides monitoring and intrusion detcetion of unusual activity
at the physical and network layers. 18F is responsible for monitoring everything
related to its virtual infrastructure and has deployed monitoring and intrusion
detection tools within its virtual private cloud to log and detect malicious
activities to its information systems including cloud.gov.

### Part d

18F ensures intrusion and monitoring tools are protected from unauthorized access
by only granting access to certain members from the cloud.gov operators.
All monitoring and intrusion information data is protected by limiting accounts
to authorized privileged users only and is maintained in secured repositories
for review by those members.

### Part e

Information system monitoring will
be heightened based on advisories from Pivotal, US-CERT Advisories, commercial
security communities, and other sources.

### Part f

Information system monitoring will be conducted in accordance and compliance
with 18F security policies and all applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives,
and regulations.

### Part g

18F provides monitoring of all information system components. In the event
of an event or incident, information will be provided as it is available.  Scheduled
reports will be provided for events such as after-hours administrative logins,
users being added to privileged groups, persistent malware detections, etc.,
to designated members of the cloud.gov operators as needed.
