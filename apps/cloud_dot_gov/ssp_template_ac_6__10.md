## Access Control Policies for 18F

The cloud.gov platform has built-in role based access controls (RBAC). This
ensures that users can only view and affect the spaces for which they have been
granted access to. It also prevents non-privileged users from executing privileged
functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security
safeguards/countermeasures.
Only designated Org Managers from the DevOps team can execute privileged functions
to the cloud.gov platform. All other accounts are non-privileged accounts.
Client agencies using cloud.gov are only permitted to change settings within their
associated Org account, spaces and roles. These accounts do not have access to the
underlying cloud.gov platform.
