## Contingency Planning Policy for 18F

### Part c

Planned Implementation:

After exercises are completed, the disaster recovery team reviews the exercise results and initiate corrective actions
if necessary. If a disaster recovery test finding leads to a change to Cloud.Gov’s IT infrastructure, 18F will require
the change to be documented, tested and approved by going through 18F’s change control process.
