## Contingency Planning Policy for 18F

Planned Implementation:

18F will provide contingency training to information system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities:
within 10 days of assuming a contingency role or responsibility, when required by information system changes and will
provide contingency training on an annual basis thereafter.
