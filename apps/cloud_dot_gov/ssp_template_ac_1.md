## Access Control Policies for 18F

### Part a

The 18F Program Office develops, documents, and disseminates
to all 18F staff the 18F Access Control Policy which addresses purpose, scope,
roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational
entities, compliance, and procedures to facilitate the implementation of
the access control policy and associated access controls. The 18F Access Control
Policy is listed within 18Fâ€™s private Github repository and the docs.cloud.gov
site that is accessible to all 18F staff.

### Part b

The 18F Program Office
will review and update the current 18F Access Control Policy at least every
3 years and any documented access procedures at least annually.
