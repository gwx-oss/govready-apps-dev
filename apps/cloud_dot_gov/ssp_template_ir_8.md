## Incident Response for cloud.gov

### Part a

The cloud.gov team has developed both an Incident Response Guide and checklist to implement incident response capabilities.
Given the small size of the cloud.gov team, the structure of the incident response process is clear and concise; it assigns the first responder to the event the role of Incident Commander.
The Incident Response Guide provides clear guidance on what steps to take on each situation and how reporting should be handled.
The Incident Response Guide empowers the Incident Commander to leverage as many resources from GSA and 18F as needed during the response process.
The Incident Response Guide is continually reviewed and updated by the cloud.gov team and approved annually by the Authorizing Official.

### Part b

The Incident Response Guide is distributed to the whole of the cloud.gov team.

### Part c

The Incident Response Guide is continually reviewed and updated by the cloud.gov team.

### Part d

The Incident Response Guide is continually reviewed and updated by the cloud.gov team in response to system and organizational updates.

### Part e

The cloud.gov team distributes changes to the Incident Response Guide to the whole cloud.gov team.

### Part f

The Incident Response Guide is stored in GitHub as a public open source file. The branch from which the document is generated is a protected branch forbidding the unauthorized deletion of revision history. Moreover, the cloud.gov team has both configured the repository and provided team policies to ensure strict controls on who has authority to approve changes to this guide.
