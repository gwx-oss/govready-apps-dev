    \ for individuals depends on the safeguards\nemployed within the information systems\
    \ that are processing, storing, and transmitting\nPersonally Identifiable Information\
    \ (PII) and the environments in which those systems\noperate. Organizations cannot\
    \ have effective privacy without a basic foundation of\ninformation security.\
    \ \n\nWe'll walk you through a Privacy Impact Analysis (PIA). When you are finished\
    \ with the\nPIA, you will have a shopping list of documents that you need to file\
    \ away and a set\nof security controls that your system must implement.\n\nAre\
    \ you ready?\n"
