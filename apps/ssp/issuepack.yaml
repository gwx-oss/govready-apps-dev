  body: |2

    *Why*
    We don’t want to lose critical audit records because of errors in the auditing system.


    *How*
    * Set up monitoring to detect issues with the audit system. Examples:
      * Pingdom
      * Amazon CloudWatch
      * New Relic
    * A custom script monitoring updated timestamps
    * Decide who should receive alerts.
    * Determine an effective test frequency and alert method (text, email, Slack).
    * Check the audit system monitors every two months to ensure they are working properly.

    *Acceptance Criteria / Evidence*
    * List of the people and method to alert when there are issues with the audit system.

- title: As the CISO, I want transactions in logs to clearly use a UTC timestamps
    so data can be synchronized with less processing.
  body: |
    *Why*
    Reports need to be timestamped with an universally understood format to assist in analysis of events and system/data recovery.
    When different logs use different timezones and/or non-standard formats, it is harder to collate and compare events across different logs.


    *How*
    * Create organization standard for transaction record timestamp granularity of least 1 second
    * Create record timestamping mechanism that timestamps transactions with defined granularity in UTC or GMT
    * Timestamp with a system’s clock


    *Acceptance Criteria / Evidence*
    * Excerpt from STIG or SRG in use that defines timestamp granularity standard
    * Show example of logged events are being timestamped or configuration that forces timestamps
