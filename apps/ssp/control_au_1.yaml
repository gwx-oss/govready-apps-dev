    {% if project.system_stack.application_where_hosted and project.system_stack.application_where_hosted != "onpremesis" %}
      The system is not hosted on premesis and so it does not need a DMZ.

      The system is using our enterprise DMZ.

    {% else %}

      The system is not using our enterprise DMZ. {{have_other_dmz.text}}
