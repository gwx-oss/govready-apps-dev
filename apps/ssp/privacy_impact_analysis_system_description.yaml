  prompt: >
    What types of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) are collected?


    PII is defined by OMB Memorandum 07-16 as information which can be used to distinguish
    or

    trace an individual’s identity such as their name, social security number, biometric
    records,

    etc., alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which
    is linked

    or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother’s
    maiden name,

    etc. OMB Memorandum 10-22 further states that “the definition of PII is not anchored
    to any

    single category of information or technology. Instead, it requires a case-by-case
    assessment

    of the specific risk that an individual can be identified by examining the context
    of use and

    combination of data elements. In performing this assessment, it is important for
    everyone to

    recognize that non-PII can become PII, whenever additional information is made
    publicly available,

    in any medium and from any source that, when combined with other available information,
    could

    be used to identify an individual.

    What is the purpose of collecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in the system?

    Describe the purpose(s) for which PII is collected, used, maintained, and shared.

    {#
      NIST 800-53 Rev 4, Appendix J, AP-2
      the purposes are clearly described in the related privacy compliance documentation,
      including but not limited to Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), System of Records Notices
      (SORNs), and Privacy Act Statements provided at the time of collection (e.g., on forms
      organizations use to collect PII). Further, in order to avoid unauthorized collections or
      uses of PII, personnel who handle PII receive training on the organizational authorities
      for collecting PII, authorized uses of PII, and on the contents of the notice.
