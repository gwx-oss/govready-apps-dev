Motivation
==========
{{organization}}'s of staff, contractors, and all those who have access to {{organization}}’s systems must uphold acceptable security practices while interacting with {{organization}}’s systems, and while handling {{organization}}’s information. These practices provide practical guidance, designed to ensure that {{organization}}’s systems and information remain protected while {{organization}} staff and contractors carry out their responsibilities.

Information Handling
====================

### Passwords and Authentication
{{organization}} uses strong passwords and keeps them safe at all times. {{organization}} requires passwords used for work-related accounts, including systems owned by {{organization}} and from external providers. Passwords used for GovReady-related accounts, including systems owned by {{organization}} and from external providers, must be strong and difficult to guess or computationally expensive to crack. 

{{organization}} uses two Factor Authentication for all systems that support it. The use of an authenticator application, such as Google Authenticator or Authy, is recommended over use of SMS for Two Factor Authentication.

{{organization}} requires SSH keys be protected with passphrases and the passphrase is either memorized or stored in approved Password Management software.

> #### Practices for Individuals
> 
> You are responsible for the management of your account credentials and the quality of your passwords.
> 
> Use two Factor Authentication for all systems that support it. The use of an authenticator application, such as Google Authenticator or Authy, is recommended over use of SMS for Two Factor Authentication.
> 
> Create and use SSH keys with passphrases and either memorize the passphrase or store the passphrases in approved Password Management software.
> 
> Store your passwords only in an approved Password Manager.
> 
> | Approved Password Managers | Website                                  |
> |:---------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
> | LastPass                   | https://www.lastpass.com                 |

> | Apple Keychain             | https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085 |
> 
> Pick unique, difficult to guess passwords. Passwords must:
> 
> - Be at least 10 characters long
> - Not be used for any other accounts, including personal accounts
> - Be kept secret
> - Not be written down or stored anywhere except in approved Password Management software

### Client Data
{{organization}} considers client data, and data from production systems to be especially sensitive and handled with additional care. {{organization}} always encrypts client data in transit, and at rest (for example on an encrypted hard drive). {{organization}} does not transmit client data via email, unless requested explicitly by the client, and instead uses secure file sharing services. {{organization}} data securely archives and/or destroys client information as soon as it is no longer required to provide customer support or for legal requirements.
