    The IT System Rules of Behavior describes users' responsibilities and expected behavior when using the IT System.

    The Rules of Behavior define that the system administrator, based on need-to-know, assigns the proper permissions to system users.

    The Rules of Behavior define that the employee’s manager approves the access rights before the initial account is created by signing off on the forms.

    All users (privileged and program account users) requesting access to the IT System are required to read the IT System Rules of Behaviors, complete an account request form and sign both documents. User access is controlled by the completion and submission of IT System Rules of Behavior and New User Account Request forms by the user and management. These items are completed and submitted whenever a new user requires access or an existing user requires access changes.
