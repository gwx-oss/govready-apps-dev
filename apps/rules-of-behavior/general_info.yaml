    FISMA compliance requires Rules of Behavior 

    Rules of Behavior describe "the responsibilities and expected behavior" of users and administrators of
    your organization's information systems and devices.

    Rules of Behavior are generally established at the organizational level. 

    In this module, we will gather general information about your Rules of Behavior: who manages it,
    how users agree to it, and recordkeeping.

  title: Policy Maintenance Statement for Rules of Behavior for Control PL-4
  template: |

    {% if exists == 'yes' %}

    {{organization}} has implemented Control PL-4 with its existing Rules of Behavior document
    officially entitled _{{official_name}}_.

    {% if source_public == 'yes' %}
    The Rules of Behavior is available online at the public url [{{source_public_url}}]({{source_public_url}}).
    {% else %}
    The Rules of Behavior is not available publicly online.
    {% endif %}
    The {{role_owner}} maintains the Rules of Behavior as a {{source_repo.text}} for editing and reviews
    the Rules of Behavior {{review_frequency.text}}. {{source_repo_identifier}}

    {{obtain}} Recordkeeping for the signed Rules of Behavior is maintained by {{organization}}'s 
    {% if maintain == 'other' %} {{maintain_other}} {% else %} {{maintain.text}} {% endif %}.

    {% else %}

    {{organization}} has not implemented Control PL-4. Once our Rules of Behavior is written, it 
    will be managed in accordance with the following procedures.

    {% if source_public == 'yes' %}
    The Rules of Behavior will be available online at the public url {{source_public_url}}.
    {% else %}
    The Rules of Behavior will not be available publicly online.
    {% endif %}
    The {{role_owner}} will maintain the Rules of Behavior as a {{source_repo.text}} for editing and will review
    the Rules of Behavior {{review_frequency.text}}. {{source_repo_identifier}}

    {{obtain}} Recordkeeping for the signed Rules of Behavior will be maintained by {{organization}}'s 
    {% if maintain == 'other' %} {{maintain_other}} {% else %} {{maintain.text}} {% endif %}.

    {% endif %}
