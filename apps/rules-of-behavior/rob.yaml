      Don't over think this. Rules of Behavior are just the major Do's and Dont's
      users and administrators receive and agree to abide by as part of their pre-access
      training. (The requirement flows from See Section (h) of Appendix III to OMB
      Circular A-130 and NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-18, Rev. 1 implemented
      under FISMA.)
