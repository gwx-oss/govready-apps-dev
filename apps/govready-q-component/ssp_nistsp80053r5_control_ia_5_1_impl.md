{{organization}} uses GovReady-Q to for password-based authentication:

      [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and when organizational passwords are
      suspected to have been compromised directly or indirectly;
(b) Verify, when users create or update passwords, that the passwords are not found on the
    organization-defined list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords;
(c)   Transmit only cryptographically-protected passwords;
(d) Store passwords using an approved hash algorithm and salt, preferably using a keyed hash;
(e)   Require immediate selection of a new password upon account recovery;
(f)   Allow user selection of long passwords and passphrases, including spaces and all printable
      characters; and
