## Docker Enterprise Edition (Engine)

'Docker Enterprise Edition is designed to run application containers
whose content can be completely isolated/segregated from other
application containers within the same node/cluster. This is
accomplished by way of Linux kernel primitives and various security
profiles that can be applied to the underlying host OS. Additional
information can be found at the following resources:
