## Docker Security Scanning (DSS)

'To assist the orgnization in meeting the requirements of this
control, the Docker Security Scanning component of Docker Trusted
Registry (DTR) that is included with the Docker Enterprise Edition
Advanced tier compiles a bill of materials (BOM) for each Docker image
that it scans. DSS is also synchronized to an aggregate listing of
known vulnerabilities that is compiled from both the MITRE and NVD CVE
databases. Additional information can be found at the following resources:

- https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/dtr/2.2/guides/admin/configure/set-up-vulnerability-scans/
