## Universal Control Plane (UCP)

'Universal Control Plane users can be assigned to one of a number of
different permission levels. The permission level assigned to a
specific user determines that user''s ability to execute certain
Docker functions within UCP. Only users mapped to either the "Full
Control" or "Admin" roles can execute Docker commands without any
restrictions. Users mapped to either the "View Only" or "No Access"
roles cannot execute any Docker commands. Users assigned to the
"Restricted Control" role can only run Docker commands under their own
purview and cannot see other users UCP resources nor run commands that
required privileged access to the host. Additional documentation
regarding the various permission levels within UCP can be found at the
following resource:
