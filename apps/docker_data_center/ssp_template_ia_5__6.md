## Authentication and Authorization Service (eNZi)

'The organization is responsible for meeting the requirements of this
control. To assist with meeting these requirements, an external
directory service integrated with Docker Enterprise Edition via LDAP can be
configured to protect authenticators as required by this control.
Refer to your directory service's documentation for configuring this.'
