## Docker Enterprise Edition (Engine)

'Docker Enterprise Edition can be configured to control the flow of
information that originates from applications running in containers
per organization-defined security policy filters. Supporting
documentation can be found at the following resources:

- https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/
- http://success.docker.com/Datacenter/Apply/Docker_Reference_Architecture%3A_Designing_Scalable%2C_Portable_Docker_Container_Networks

There are also third-party behavioral activity monitoring tools (e.g.
Sysdig Falco <http://www.sysdig.org/falco/>) that can be used
alongside Docker Enterprise Edition to satisfy this control''s
requirements.'
