## Docker Enterprise Edition (Engine)

'Docker Enterprise Edition includes functionality known as Docker
Content Trust which allows one to cryptographically sign Docker
images. It enforces client-side signing and verification of image tags
and provides the ability to use digital signatures for data sent to
and received from Docker Trusted Registry. This ultimately provides
one with the ability to verify both the integrity and the publisher of
all data received from DTR over any channel. With Docker Content
Trust, an organization can enforce signature verification of all
content and prohibit unsigned and unapproved content from being
manipulated; thus supproting the non-repudiation requirements of this
control. Additional information can be found at the following
