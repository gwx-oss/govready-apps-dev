## Docker Enterprise Edition (Engine)

'The CIS Docker Benchmark can be used as a baseline for securing
Docker Enterprise Edition and for helping the organization meet the
configurmation management requirements of this control. CIS regularly
updates their benchmark to reflect the latest updates in the stable
release of Docker Engine. Various configuration management tools such
as Inspec (http://inspec.io/) can be used to audit Docker Enterprise
Edition system configuration to ensure that the secure baseline
configurations have been applied in an automated fashion and can be
rolled back as required by this control. Additional information can be
found at the following resources:
