## Docker Enterprise Edition (Engine)

'All remote access sessions to Docker Enterprise Edition are protected
with Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 with the AES GCM cipher. In
addition to this, all communication to/from and between Docker
Enterprise Edition nodes is enforced by way of two-way mutual TLS
authentication. All Swarm Mode manager nodes in a Docker Enterprise
Edition cluster store state metadata and user secrets encrypted at
rest using the AES GCM cipher.'
