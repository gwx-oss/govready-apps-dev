## Authentication and Authorization Service (eNZi)

'Docker Enterprise Edition logs privileged user events to standard log
files. One can configure Docker Enterprise Edition to direct these
event logs to a remote logging service such as an Elasticsearch,
Logstash and Kibana (ELK) stack and subsequently alert on specific
event types. When integrating Docker Enterprise Edition with LDAP, one
can refer the the directory service''s logging mechanisms for auditing
the events defined by this control. Supporting documentation regarding
logging and monitoring can be found at the following resources:

- https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.0/guides/monitor/
- https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.0/guides/configuration/configure-logs/'
