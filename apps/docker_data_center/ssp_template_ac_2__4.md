## Authentication and Authorization Service (eNZi)

'Docker Enterprise Edition logs various authentication and
authorization events to standard log files. One can configure Docker
Enterprise Edition to direct these event logs to a remote logging
service such as an Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (ELK) stack and
subsequently alert on specific event types. When integrating Docker
Enterprise Edition with LDAP, one can refer the the directory
service''s logging mechanisms for auditing the events defined by this
control. Supporting documentation can be found at the following
