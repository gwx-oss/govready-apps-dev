## Authentication and Authorization Service (eNZi)

'Using Docker Enterprise Edition''s LDAP integration capabilities, one
can disable and/or remove temporary and emergency accounts in a
connected directory service (such as Active Directory) after an
organization-defined time period. When a user is removed from LDAP,
that user becomes inactive after the LDAP synchronization runs.
Supporting documentation can be found at the following resources:
