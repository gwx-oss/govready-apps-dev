## Docker Security Scanning (DSS)

'For each Docker image pushed to Docker Trusted Registry at a given
time, Docker Security Scaninng retains a list of vulnerabilities
detected. The DTR API can be queried to retrieve the vulnerability
scan results over a period of time for a given Docker image such that
the results can be compared per the requirements of this control.'
