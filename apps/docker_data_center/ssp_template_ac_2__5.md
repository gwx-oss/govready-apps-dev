## Authentication and Authorization Service (eNZi)

'To assist the organization in meeting the requirements of this
control, Docker Enterprise Edition can be configured to enforce automated
session termination of users after an organization-defined time period
of inactivity. By default, the initial lifetime of a user''s session
is set to 72 hours and the renewal session for a user''s session is
set to 24 hours. These values can both be changed in the "Auth"
section of the "Admin Settings" in Universal Control Plane.'
