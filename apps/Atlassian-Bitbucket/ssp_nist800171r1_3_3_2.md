{{organization}} uses Atlassian Bitbucket to manage changes to source code and configuration files for systems containing CUI. Atlassian Bitbucket provides a complete audit trail of all changes made to system source code files stored in its repositories including which users made changes. {{organization}} uses Atlassian Bitbucket Git commit histories to ensure that the actions of individual system users modifying source code files can be uniquely traced to those users so they can be held accountable for their actions.
