        FISMA starts here.
        
        Your system's FISMA level is determined by the impact of a loss of confidentiality,
        integrity, and availability of your system on your organization's mission and on
        potential harm to others.

        We'll help you figure out your system's FISMA level.

    ## System Categorization (Determine FISMA Level)

    Before you embark on your ATO under FISMA, you must know if your system is

    - FISMA Low
    - FISMA Moderate
    - FISMA High

    Your system's FISMA level is determined by the impact of a loss of confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of your system on your organization's mission and on
    potential harm to others.

    We'll help you figure out your system's FISMA level.
