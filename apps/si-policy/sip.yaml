    System and Information Integrity Policy 

    In this module, we'll ask you to describe the overall activities your organization systematically takes to protect the integrity of its IT systems and information. 

    {% if project.general_info.exists == "no" %}
    You said your organization's System and Information Integrity Policy doesn't exist. We'll draft a version from your answers to these questions.
    {% endif %}
    
    This information will {% if project.general_info.exists == "no" %}also{% endif %} be used to describe the essense of your SI Policy in your compliance documentation for auditors.

    SAMPLE System and Information Integrity Policy and Procedures adopted from GSA 18F {Cloud.gov} SI Policy
  template: |

    (SAMPLE System and Information Integrity Policy and Procedures adopted from [GSA 18F {Cloud.gov} SI Policy](https://github.com/18F/compliance-docs/blob/master/SI-Policy.md))

    # System and Information Integrity Policy

    ## Purpose

    Ensures information systems have not been compromised through system errors, malicious attacks, or unauthorized access during operation and transmission.

    ## Scope

    This IT Security Policy applies to all {{organization}} Employees and {{organization}} contractors or vendors who manage, maintain, operate, or protect {{organization}} systems or data, all {{organization}} IT systems, and any {{organization}} data contained on or processed by IT systems owned and operated by or on the behalf of any of the Services or Staff Offices.

    All {{organization}} employees and contracts are subject to these policies.

    {Contracting Officers must include compliance with this policy in the contract or task order for contractor employees (see Chapter 1 Section 11).}

    {This policy applies to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) only to the extent that the OIG determines it is consistent with the OIG’s independent authority under the IG Act and it does not conflict with other OIG policies or the OIG mission.}

    ## Roles and responsibilities

    The {{organization}}'s {responsible_role} is responsible for ensuring that all employees and contracts are familiar and trained in these policies, and to ensure that appropriate procedures are established and tested. 

    The {{organization}}'s {responsible_role} is responsible for all procedures and implementations.

    The {{project.general_info.role_owner}} maintains the System and Information Integrity Policy and Procedures and reviews
    the System and Information Integrity Policy and Procedures {{project.general_info.review_frequency.text}}. 


    The {project.general_info.role_owner} is responsible for disimenating this policy to all employees and contracts and vendors.  

    ## Organizational Procedures

    {{organization}} has implemented multiple procedures and requires to insure system and information integrity. These procedures include: {flaw remediation; protection against malicious code; information system monitoring; use of security alerts; advisories and directives; security function verification; software, firmware, and information integrity; protection against spam; restrictions on input of information; validation on information input, error handling, information handling and retention, predictable failure prevention, non-persistence, information output filtering, memory protection, fail-safe procedures}.

    {% for procedure in si_organizational_procedures %}* {{procedure.text|safe}}
    {% endfor %}

    High-risk vulnerabilities are mitigated within thirty days (30); moderate risk vulnerabilities mitigated within ninety days (90). All findings that are not remediated immediately are tracked in the {cloud.gov} Plan of Action and Milestones (POAM).

    ## System-Specific Procedures

    {{organization}} also requires each IT system implements system-specific procedures to insure system and information integrity. Required system-specific procedures include: {flaw remediation; protection against malicious code; information system monitoring; use of security alerts; advisories and directives; security function verification; software, firmware, and information integrity; protection against spam; restrictions on input of information; validation on information input, error handling, information handling and retention, predictable failure prevention, non-persistence, information output filtering, memory protection, fail-safe procedures}.


    {% for procedure in si_system_procedures %}
      * {{procedure.text|safe}}
    {% endfor %}


    The {Cloud Operations team} follows the [Security Incident Response Guide](https://cloud.gov/docs/ops/security-ir/) upon detection of any potential security incident.

    The {cloud.gov team} identifies {cloud.gov} system flaws, tracks and reports them, and corrects them.

    The {Cloud Operations team} monitors upstream projects {(including Cloud Foundry)} for new releases, implements the new releases {(including promptly installing newly-released security-relevant patches)}, and tests patches for effectiveness and potential side effects on information systems before installation. {The testing takes place in development and test environments.}

    {Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and information system error handling are addressed through the {cloud.gov configuration management process}.}

    The {Cloud Operations team} uses automated mechanisms, including automated monthly scans, to determine the state of flaw remediation in information system components.  {cloud.gov} management and security staff track the status of flaws identified with automated vulnerability scan tools using the monthly scan results.

    {cloud.gov} keeps all flaw identifications and remediations stored in machine readable data within its issue tracker. Time between identifications and remediations is always tracked, and is also reflected in the Plan of Actions and Milestones (POAM).

    See SI-2, SI-2 (2), SI-2 (3).

    {cloud.gov} employs tools at information system entry and exit points to detect and eradicate malicious code with real-time scans, with virus definitions updated hourly. These send alerts to the {Cloud Operations team} if malicious code is detected. The {Cloud Operations team} follows the [Security Incident Response Guide](https://cloud.gov/docs/ops/security-ir/) upon detection of any potential security incident.

    All 18F-developed open source code that is used in the {cloud.gov} system is scanned using static analysis tools. When anyone proposes a change to the code (a pull request), the static analysis tool automatically runs and displays results.

    See SI-3, SI-3 (1), SC-3 (2), SC-3 (7).

    The {Cloud Operations team} monitors the {cloud.gov} virtual infrastructure to detect potential attacks and intrusions from internal and external sources, including using automated monitoring tools. {Cloud Operations} monitors for attacks, indicators of potential attacks, and unauthorized connections, as well as monitoring inbound and outbound communications traffic for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions.

    All potential incidents identified by these tools are automatically processed through a centralized system that sends the information to a database and a centralized notification system.

    The {cloud.gov} Program Manager and System Owner ensure intrusion and monitoring tools are protected from unauthorized access by only granting access to certain members from the {Cloud Operations team}. All monitoring and intrusion information data is protected by limiting accounts to authorized privileged users only and is maintained in secured repositories for review by those members.

    The {cloud.gov team} uses additional sources such as Pivotal, US-CERT Advisories, OMB Mandates, commercial and open source security communities, and other sources to provide indication of increased risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations.

    See SI-4, SI-4 (1), SI-4 (2), SI-4 (4), SI-4 (5), SI-4 (14), SI-4 (16), SI-4 (23).

    When the {cloud.gov team} receives security directives from {GSA Information Security}, {Cloud Operations} implements the directives in accordance with the requested time frames, or notifies the issuing organization of the degree of noncompliance.

    See SI-5.

    {cloud.gov} verifies the correct operation of services that detect malicious code, viruses, file integrity, network traffic, and security compliance of the OS using a continuous integration tool (Concourse) and automated monitoring tools. The {Cloud Operations team} is notified of a failure in security verification via PagerDuty.

    See SI-6, SI-7, SI-7 (1), SI-7 (7).

    All inputs passed to CLI interpreters are pre-screened to prevent the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands.

    All user input submitted via web forms is sanitized to prevent it being interpreted as a system command.

    See SI-10.

    PagerDuty sends {cloud.gov} alerts only to a limited set of {cloud.gov team} members who have privileged access to {cloud.gov} components (System Owner, Program Manager, {Cloud Operations team} members). This PagerDuty configuration is the responsibility of the Program Manager, who may delegate this to {Cloud Operations team} members.

    See SI-11.
