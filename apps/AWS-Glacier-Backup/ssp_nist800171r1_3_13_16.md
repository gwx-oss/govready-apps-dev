__Organization__ stores all backups containing CUI __only__ in Amazon Glacier to protect the confidentiality of backup CUI at rest. Amazon Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost cloud storage service for data archiving and long-term backup. Amazon Glacier supports data transfer over SSL and automatically encrypts data at rest. Amazon Glacier is off site relative to __Organization__'s systems containing CUI. See https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/ for additional information. Amazon Glacier uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256). 256-bit is the largest key size defined for AES (see: https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/faqs/#dataretrievals).
